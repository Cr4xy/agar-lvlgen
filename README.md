# agar-lvlgen

## Tutorial
###### How-To:
1. Get your Facebook-Cookies, and put them into the config.
2. Edit the config
3. Run Start.bat (on windows) or run it through a terminal

## Config
###### How to edit your config:
When you have your cookies, replace them in the config to make it farm for your account.
Aditionally, you can specify the name of your bots, the amount and more.

When you first downloaded the lvlgen, your config should look something like this:
```
module.exports = {
	// Required
	
	accounts: [
		{
			c_user: "c_user",
			datr: "datr",
			xs: "xs"
		}
	],
	
	name: "agar-lvlgen",
	
	// Advanced
	regions: ["BR-Brazil", "CN-China", "EU-London", "JP-Tokyo", "RU-Russia", "SG-Singapore", "TK-Turkey", "US-Atlanta"],
	statusDelay: 1000,
	
	/* Possible values:
	 *
	 * default: Primitive "AI", low cpu usage
	 * apos: Smart AI, higher cpu usage (still buggy)
	 * 
	*/
	ai: "default"
}
```
In order to make it work you only need to replace ```c_user```, ```datr``` and ```xs``` with your cookies. You can also have multiple accounts:
```
	accounts: [
		{
			c_user: "c_user",
			datr: "datr",
			xs: "xs"
		},
		{
			c_user: "c_user",
			datr: "datr",
			xs: "xs"
		}
	],
```
All other options are optional.
